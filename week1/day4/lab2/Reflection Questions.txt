During this sprint, our team of four — Turan (Product Owner), Miri (Scrum Master), Yunis and Ravan (Developers), worked together to deliver a CI Build Status Dashboard. The experience revealed how Scrum's structure supports both adaptability and quality under pressure.

1) Adaptation was tested immediately on Day 1 when Yunis and Me(Ravan) discovered that the CI API documentation was outdated and did not match actual endpoints. Rather than halting all work, Miri logged the impediment and the team made a pragmatic decision: continue building the UI and modal components while the API issue was being investigated. This parallel approach kept momentum alive. On Day 3, when API response times proved too slow, the team collectively agreed to add a simple caching task — a decision made possible by reviewing our remaining capacity and Sprint Goal alignment. The filter bug discovered on Day 4 was another inflection point; Me(Ravan) prioritized fixing it while the team deprioritized Build Notifications (US-4), deferring it to the next sprint without compromising core quality.

2) Daily Scrums were the engine of our coordination. On Day 2, Miri's update — that the DevOps team had provided corrected API documentation — immediately unblocked Yunis and Ravan and shifted the entire team's energy. Without that structured daily touchpoint, this resolution might have taken far longer to surface. Transparency was especially critical on Day 3 when Yunis openly flagged that API responses were slowing the dashboard — a disclosure that led directly to the caching solution.

3)Having a clear Sprint Goal — "Enable developers to monitor and investigate CI build status effectively" — proved decisive on Day 2 when a stakeholder requested email notifications. Turan confidently deferred this to the Product Backlog, citing Sprint Goal focus. Without that anchor, the team could have easily been pulled in the wrong direction.

4)The Definition of Done created healthy tension throughout. On Day 4, when the filter bug emerged, there was an implicit pressure to ship and fix later. Instead, the team added the bug fix as a formal task and held the line — all completed stories were demonstrated against full acceptance criteria in the Sprint Review, and Turan verified each one accordingly.

5)The Sprint Retrospective surfaced three clear improvement areas: starting mid-sprint backlog refinement, stopping integration testing delays, and stopping work without API confirmation upfront. The most impactful action item for Sprint 2 will be starting API documentation early — the Day 1 impediment could have been prevented entirely with pre-sprint API validation.

6)The strongest demonstration of Scrum values came on Day 2 when Turan exercised Courage by rejecting the stakeholder's email notification request mid-sprint. Protecting the Sprint Goal over stakeholder pressure is rarely comfortable, but it directly contributed to the team achieving a velocity of 11 story points with the Sprint Goal fully met.
